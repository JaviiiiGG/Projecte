# Pre-release versions #

You can test pre-release (beta) versions manually by downloading and installing the .vsix file published on the release page.

You can stick with the beta version until the final version is released to the marketplace. When this happens, you don't have to worry about uninstalling the beta. VS Code will automatically update to the released version, and you'll be back to stable versions.

### To download/install ###

1. Download the .vsix file from the "Assets" section of the release page (something like `rewrap-x.x.x-beta.vsix`)
2. In VS Code, press `F1` and run the command `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`. Choose the downloaded .vsix file. 
3. The beta version will be installed and you'll be prompted to restart/reload.

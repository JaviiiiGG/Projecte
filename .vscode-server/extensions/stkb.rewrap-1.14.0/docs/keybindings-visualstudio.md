# Keybindings: Visual Studio #

The Rewrap command is by default bound to `Alt+Q`. This can be changed if you wish by going to *Tools* -> *Options*, then *Environment* -> *Keyboard*. 

In this dialog pane search for the command `Edit.RewrapLines` and you can add a different shortcut. 

To add a shortcut for the "Toggle Auto-Wrap" command, search for `Edit.ToggleAutoWrap`.
